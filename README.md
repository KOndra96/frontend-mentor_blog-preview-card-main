# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card

This is my solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). 
It's a LEVEL 1 - NEWBIE challenge.

I'm returning to coding after a few years so I don't expect this to be a perfect way of making the website. However, it provided me with a few challenges and helped me realize why some good practice is in fact good practice.

Thanks for checking my work out.
